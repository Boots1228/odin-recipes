   <h3>Ingredients</h3>
   <ul>
     <li>2 whole chickens (mine were 1.8 kilos per chicken)
     <li>Bamboo sticks or skewers</li>
     <li>Charcoal</li>  
     <p><b>For the marinade</b></p>
     <li>4 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
     <li>1 tablespoon fish sauce</li>
     <li>2 tablespoons palm sugar</li>
     <li>1 tablespoon dark sweet soy sauce (substitute some Indonesian kecap manis)</li>
     <li>8 tablespoons water</li>
     <li>4 heads garlic (30 – 40 cloves)</li>
     <li>2 stalks lemongrass</li>
     <li>2.5 tablespoons black pepper corns</li>
     <li>8 coriander roots (optional, but highly recommended if you can find them, you can also try the powder version)</li>
   </ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <b>Chicken marinade</b><p>
     <li>Peel about 4 bulbs of garlic, which should be about 30 - 40 cloves in all.</li><p>
     <li>Thinly slice 2 stalks of lemongrass and cut off the roots of 8 stalks of coriander.</li><p>
     <li>Pounding everything using a mortar and pestle.If you don’t have a mortar and pestle you can blend the ingredients in a food processor (but I’d really recommend you invest in a Thai style mortar and pestle).</li><p>
     <li>Add small amounts of garlic, lemongrass, black peppercorns, and coriander roots to the mortar and pestle and pound them until the oils come out, and you have a coarse paste.</li><p>
     <li>Put all the pounded marinade ingredients in a mixing bowl, stir them up, and add 4 tablespoons of light soy sauce, 1 tablespoon of dark soy sauce, 1 tablespoon of fish sauce, and 2 tablespoons of palm sugar. <p>Mix everything together while adding about 8 tablespoons of water to the mixture. You should end up with a potent marinade that looks like a chunky garlicky sauce.</p></li>
     <li>If you’re using whole chickens, you'll want to butterfly cut them starting from the breast side down to the butt. Flatten the chickens out. This is going to prepare it for the grill </li><p>
     <li> In a big pan or mixing bowl start to rub the marinade on the chicken, making sure the garlic, herbs, and soy sauce go into all parts of the chicken.</li><p>
     <li>Rub down both chickens using all the marinade.Cover the chickens and allow them to rest overnight. You might stir them a couple of times.</li>
</ol>
